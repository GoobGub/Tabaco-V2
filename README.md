if you get the error "Python was not found; run without arguments to install from the Microsoft Store, or disable this shortcut from Settings > Manage App Execution Aliases."

go to microsoft store and install python 3.8 3.9 3.10 from the microsoft store then run SETUP.bat again

If you are on mac or linux 


1 install python with https://python.org need python 3.8 to 3.10

2 install pip

3 Change the file name of setup.bat to setup.txt and such

4 open and copy all the pip install stuff and everything inside the .bat

5 paste into the setup.txt

6 open the tools not the menu.py just the tools 

7 then you can start running the tools manully

Dear Skids

i am a new up and coming programmer take it easy on me

made bye GPT 3 ⬇



knowing that you have been attempting to take credit for the code that I have worked tirelessly to develop. It is disheartening to see that all of my hard work and dedication has been disregarded in this way.

Please understand that the code I have created is a product of my passion, my skills, and my time. It is the result of countless hours of research, experimentation, and trial and error. Each line of code represents a piece of my creativity, my problem-solving abilities, and my vision for what this code can accomplish.

It is not fair, nor is it just, for you to attempt to claim ownership of this code. By doing so, you are not only disrespecting me and my hard work, but you are also committing an act of intellectual property theft.

I implore you to reconsider your actions and recognize the importance of integrity, honesty, and respect in the development of code. Instead of trying to take credit for someone else's work, I encourage you to use your skills and creativity to create something unique and valuable.

Remember, true success is not measured by how much credit we receive, but rather by the positive impact we make on the world around us. Let us work together with integrity, respect, and collaboration to create a brighter future for ourselves and our community.
