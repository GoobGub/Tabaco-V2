if you get the error "Python was not found; run without arguments to install from the Microsoft Store, or disable this shortcut from Settings > Manage App Execution Aliases."

go to microsoft store and install python 3.8 3.9 3.10 from the microsoft store then run SETUP.bat again

If you are on mac or linux 


1 install python with https://python.org need python 3.8 to 3.10

2 install pip

3 Change the file name of setup.bat to setup.txt and such

4 open and copy all the pip install stuff and everything inside the .bat

5 paste into the setup.txt

6 open the tools not the menu.py just the tools 

7 then you can start running the tools manully
